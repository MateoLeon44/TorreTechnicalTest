## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Concept

The test helps people who post jobs to compare their best fits. By this, people can contact them with ease without having to go with many applications. Right now, if you see console of the best fits section, even though it doesn't show any candidate, it logs the people who fit the job because of their skills (not taking into account other features)

## How to run

You can either start it by running node app.js and ng serve having mongodb running.
